# FSM-Based-Edge-Detector
- In this project we have designed an FSM based Edge Detector. The purpose of the positive edge detector is to detect a 0 to 1 transition on input a. There are two conditions that must be met to detect a 0 to 1 transition on a. 
- A sequential circuit is a circuit with memory. A Finite State Machine (FSM) is a mathematical model of the sequential circuit with discrete inputs, discrete outputs and a finite number of internal configurations or states. The state of a system completely summarizes the information concerning the past inputs to the system that is needed to determine its behavior on subsequent inputs.
- The FSM approach to sequential system design is a straightforward generic approach that allows any sequential system to be designed.
- A sequential system may be either asynchronous or synchronous. An asynchronous sequential system has no clock and its state can change value as soon as any of its inputs changes value. In asynchronous system, asynchronous actions are limited to the external reset used to force the synchronous system into an initial state at power on.

- A FSM’s inputs are sampled at each triggering clock edge. The present state is stored as a binary value in the state register.

- A Moore FSM’s output is a function of only its present state.
